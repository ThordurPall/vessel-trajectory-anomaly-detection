# Vessel Trajectory Anomaly Detection
This is a Git repository accompanying the "Vessel Trajectory Anomaly Detection Using Deep Learning Methods" master project. Based on work done in https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00682, this project constructs trajectory-based models to discriminate between legitimate fishing vessel activities and anomalous events using historical AIS data. The proposed approach uses a variational recurrent neural network that learns a distribution representing the data that can state the reconstruction likelihood of AIS trajectories. Then for anomaly detection, a geographically-dependent a contrario detection rule is used to account for the fact that the learnt distribution may be location-dependent.
